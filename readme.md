# Minecraft Education Edition Intro

## How to Get Minecraft Education Edition

Nearly all schools in Austria have a license for Minecraft Education Edition (MEE). If you participate in this training and you do not yet have access to MEE, please perform the following steps:

1. Download MEE from [https://education.minecraft.net/de-de/get-started/download](https://education.minecraft.net/de-de/get-started/download) for your specific platform(s).
2. Install MEE on the device you want to use during the training.
3. Start MEE and try to log in **with your Microsoft 365 account from your school** (i.e. the account with which you log in e.g. to MS Teams). If you have accounts from multiple schools, try all of them until you hopefully find one that works.

If none of your accounts work or you do not have a Microsoft 365 account, contact [your trainers](mailto:r.stropek@htl-leonding.ac.at) prior to the training.

## How to Join the Training

The training will be done using **Microsoft Teams**. Make sure to have Microsoft Teams installed prior to the training.
